# FifaKing
This app is designed to help the user manage their points and their friends' points in the FIFA game.
The application uses a (temporary) Firebase server, so each user can log into their account and manage the points from there.
At the time of logging in to the app there is a possibility to login or register (of course if the user does not exist then will pop a message that the user does not exist).
When the user enters the app he can see which user is currently leading first place with the most points.
In addition, the user can enter another page where they can enter their points (victory, loss and draw) in front of another player.
In the main menu there is another button where you can see a table of all the players that are registered to the app and there you can see the name of the user and all his wins, his losses and his draw results.
There is an option through the Firebase server to turn a particular user into an administrator and then when he logs into the app (after login) he has a special menu!
